# Merging 40 years of weather data



i. The weather data is collected from [University of Delaware's website](http://climate.geog.udel.edu/~climate/html_pages/download.html).

ii. I use 40 years of data. From 1970-2010. Each dataframe has 14 columns, that includes Longitude, Latitude and 12 months.

iii. **This repository gives the code to merge those 40 dataframes into one**


- *this code can be used to merge multiple dataframes in to one*
